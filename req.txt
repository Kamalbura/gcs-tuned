# ==============================================================================
# requirements.txt for the GCS & Drone Cryptography Framework
#
# This file lists the essential Python packages required for the 8-algorithm
# framework. It is designed to be clean, minimal, and robust.
#
# Installation:
# 1. Activate your conda environment: `conda activate gcs-env`
# 2. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# -- Post-Quantum Cryptography --
# The official Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library wrapper.
# This single package provides Kyber, Dilithium, Falcon, and all other
# NIST PQC algorithms. It replaces older packages like 'liboqs-python'
# and 'pqcrypto'.
oqs

# -- Standard & Pre-Quantum Cryptography --
# A high-level, industry-standard cryptography library.
# We use this for its robust implementations of AES-GCM and the Camellia
# backend for your custom class.
cryptography

# A versatile, lower-level cryptography library.
# We use this for its implementation of ASCON and for its robust padding
# utilities, which are helpful for the custom SPECK and HIGHT block ciphers.
pycryptodome

# -- Drone Communication & Control --
# The standard library for MAVLink communication.
# Essential for your GCS application to talk to the drone.
pymavlink

# The standard library for MQTT communication.
# Used by your GCS application to send control signals (like crypto switching)
# to the drone fleet.
paho-mqtt

# -- Optional Legacy Package --
# You successfully installed the C++ Build Tools, so this will now install.
# NOTE: Our framework uses your *custom* camellia.py, which is a better
# solution. This is included here only for completeness or if you wish

# to experiment with it separately. It is NOT required for our framework.
